I: Started mind logging
I: Main target:
	finish "ShiftedPort"
I: Evaluated sub target:
	Finish tetrahdron mesh class
I: Begin task:
	finish json mesh loading
I: TASK:
	found that most efficint way will be implementing
	supplimentary array with addictional data on version of
	the format. is it will use multithreaded building.
	supplimentary array for faster evaluating unique tetrahedrons.
	implement surface materials as supplimentary instructions to the
	mesh instructions [meshinstr_array,mat_array]
	if tet doesnt find its material it will pick it from its parent
	or lest placed tet. if both conditions didnt occured, assign material 0.
	[[version_int],[tetinstr_array]]
